# Playing Cards Classification using Python

This project aims to classify playing cards using Python. It utilizes machine learning techniques to train a model that can identify different types of playing cards based on their images. The project assumes you have basic knowledge of Python programming and are familiar with machine learning concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.6 or higher)
- pip (Python package installer)

Additionally, you will need the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Create a new virtual environment (optional but recommended) to keep your dependencies isolated. You can use `venv`, `conda`, or any other virtual environment manager of your choice.
3. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:


5. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the `playing_cards_classification.ipynb` file.
6. Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand the project and run the code cells.

## Dataset

The project uses a custom dataset of playing cards. The dataset contains labeled images of different playing card types (e.g., Ace of Spades, King of Hearts, etc.). The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

The dataset is not included in the repository. You can create your own dataset or find publicly available datasets online.

## Model Training

The notebook guides you through the process of training a playing card classification model. It covers the following steps:
1. Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. Extracting features from the card images.
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Training a machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, etc.).
5. Evaluating the model's performance.

Feel free to experiment with different models and parameters to improve the classification accuracy.

## Inference

Once you have trained the model, you can use it to classify new playing card images. The notebook demonstrates how to load the trained model and use it to predict the card type for unseen images.

## Conclusion

The playing cards classification project provides a starting point for building an image classification system using Python. It demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to identify and categorize playing cards. You can further extend the project by adding more features, optimizing the model, or integrating it into a larger application.

Enjoy exploring and experimenting with the project!
