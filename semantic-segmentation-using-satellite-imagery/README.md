Semantic Segmentation Using Satellite Imagery
This repository contains a project on Semantic Segmentation using satellite imagery. The project involves using real images and their corresponding masked images for the task of semantic segmentation.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to perform semantic segmentation on satellite imagery. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task where each pixel in an image is classified into different categories or classes. In this case, we aim to segment and classify different objects or land cover types present in satellite images.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of pairs of real images and their corresponding masked images. The real images are actual satellite images capturing various areas, while the masked images provide pixel-wise annotations indicating the category of each pixel (e.g., vegetation, water bodies, buildings, etc.).
