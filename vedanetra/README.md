Object Detection Using Yolo and Retinal Disease Classification
This repository contains two projects:

Object Detection Using Yolo
Retinal Disease Classification
Object Detection Using Yolo
This project uses the YOLO object detection algorithm to detect objects in images. The YOLO algorithm is a fast and accurate object detection algorithm that can be used to detect a wide variety of objects.

The project was created by **Aditya Mungee, Rudra Patidar, and Md. Saquib**.

The project includes code to train a YOLO model on a custom dataset of images. The code also includes code to detect objects in images using a pre-trained YOLO model.

Retinal Disease Classification
This project uses deep learning to classify retinal diseases. The project uses a dataset of images of retinas with different diseases. The images are classified using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The project was created by Aditya Mungee, Rudra Patidar, and Md. Saquib.

The project includes code to train a CNN on the dataset of images. The code also includes code to classify retinal diseases using a pre-trained CNN.

Getting Started
To get started with the projects, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3
Tensorflow
Keras
OpenCV
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can clone the repository and start working on the projects.

Documentation
The documentation for the projects is available in the docs directory. The documentation includes instructions on how to train and use the models.
