# AI Snake Game

AI Snake Game is a Python-based implementation of the classic Snake game with an AI component. The game allows you to control the snake manually or train an AI agent to play the game autonomously.


## Features

- Play the Snake game with arrow keys or train an AI agent to play autonomously.
- The game includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Pygame.
- The AI agent uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn and improve its gameplay over time.
- The game tracks the score, and the goal is to eat food and grow the snake as long as possible without colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.
- The game provides rewards and penalties to the AI agent based on its actions and performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- Pygame library
- Numpy library
- PyTorch
